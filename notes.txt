When registering or saving a database entry, all 'required fields' must be provided at the time of saving.
So you cannot just create a blank new Job/User/Company/whatever and save() without first populating it 
with all the required fields.

ROUTER.ROUTE() - !IMPORTANT!
-The order that routes appear in a specific route.js DOES MATTER when there are routes with parameters (e.g., users/:userId). 
-For example, if users/:userId is defined before users/notes, then when an attempt is made to reach users/notes then "notes" will be taken as :userId! That is, "notes" will be taken to be a parameter at users/:userId. 
-To avoid this, place users/notes ABOVE users/:userId.

res.json also sends response code # and headers
