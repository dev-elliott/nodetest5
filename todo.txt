ROADMAP

> Complete notification generation (server side)
> 'Refreshing' our page when data changes (dashboard)
--> How to update and "notify" the user of new notifications?
> Create a way to "claim" or link users with companies
--> Allow admin to set company via a dropdown in the Users tab. (also applies to detail/user page)
> Create front end pages:
--> NewJob submit -- both user and admin views/functionality
--> NewRequest submit
--> Welcome page
--> Profile page (edit User and Company)
> Job comments
> Backend email functionality + user settings/subscriptions

Ecomonical data transfer:
Make sure I'm getting(and sending) the minimum amount of JSON data sent from the server per request.
example: I get a job, and am only displaying it's name/status...I don't need to have the comments populated, etc
Furthermore when updating and it back with a PUT, I need to only be sending the updated/changed/new/added values
That will require clientside validation/creation of a clean JSON object with jus those values
>>> When doing a find on the database, we can include or exclude any fields we want
>>> we'll want to make sure we are only pull out the data we need for each call
>>> exclude looks like: Users.find({query here}, {notifications:1})
	>>> The second set of JSON is where we specify what fields, 0 = exclude, 1 = include



Getting database entry by ID# or name
--SaveUsers(updatedData, _id)
	userToUpdate = users.getByID(_id)
	angular.extend(usertoUpdate, updatedData)
	$http.updateuser(usertoUpdate)
--GetCompanyID(companyName) //



Error handling for all apexFactory http calls in my controllers


DoesUsernameExist: database check to see if a username (email) is already entered
to prevent duplicate registries. Then direct to "forgot your password?"
---> Create server route to return true or false if username exists
---> Register.html: transform to x-editable form and implememnt the above with "onbeforesave"


LocalStorage on browser of username and password need to be encrypted!

Need to customize/stylize the tooltips so they're actually visible and readable..
I like the bootstrap style, black bg white text with a little tail to parent element


When your token expires, you need to be logged out and the token needs to be deleted from local storage.
You will then be prompted to login again.
Need to let Angular know you've been logged out somehow?


Broadcast to rootscope on data changes?
As in, there's a new notification, we need to let angular know so it can be displayed and the datapage /controller refreshed




On all our routes we want to clarify our response (res.end or res.json)
And clientside will need to react accordingly (Alert(Notifications were deleted, yay)) etc
