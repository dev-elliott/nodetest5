//TODO

Index routing:
>Need to clean up and implement just as I did with jobRouter, implement all error handling!

Routers:
> req.body.XXX = req.decoded._id; // remove the ._doc piece of this variable
> Revise permissions (verify ordinary and verify admin) per route, rather than .all()
> Getting jobs - only spit out jobs for the appropriate company per user logged in


Ecomonical data transfer:
Make sure I'm getting(and sending) the minimum amount of JSON data sent from the server per request.
example: I get a job, and am only displaying it's name/status...I don't need to have the comments populated, etc
Furthermore when updating and it back with a PUT, I need to only be sending the updated/changed/new/added values
That will require clientside validation/creation of a clean JSON object with jus those values



Getting database entry by ID# or name
--SaveUsers(updatedData, _id)
	userToUpdate = users.getByID(_id)
	angular.extend(usertoUpdate, updatedData)
	$http.updateuser(usertoUpdate)
--GetCompanyID(companyName) //

Error handling for all apexFactory http calls in my controllers


DoesUsernameExist: database check to see if a username (email) is already entered
to prevent duplicate registries. Then direct to "forgot your password?"
---> Create server route to return true or false if username exists
---> Register.html: transform to x-editable form and implememnt the above with "onbeforesave"


LocalStorage on browser of username and password need to be encrypted!

Need to customize/stylize the tooltips so they're actually visible and readable..
I like the bootstrap style, black bg white text with a little tail to parent element
